            <aside>
                Work on this assignment in groups of up to 3 students.
            </aside>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In this assignment, you will learn to work with a very large
                    dataset. You will first clean and verify the data and then
                    visualize various aspects by creating charts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the next assignment, you will learn a method for
                    analyzing the data and visualizing trends.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Background</h2>

            <aside id="acknowledgements">
                <p>
                    The dataset is courtesy of Yuchuan Lai at Carnegie Mellon
                    University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: The file "city_info.csv" is a modified version of the
                    dataset's original directory file. You can still see the
                    original if you wish - it has been renamed to
                    "city_info_original.csv" - but we won't be using it in this
                    assignment.
                </p>
            </aside>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    You are given a dataset containing daily high and low
                    temperatures for 210 U.S. cities, dating back to the late
                    1800s, and ending in 2023.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note that the temperatures are in Fahrenheit, not Celsius.
                </li>

                <li>Each city's data is in its own file.</li>
                <li>
                    The file "city_info.csv" is a directory where you can find
                    the file matching each city, the region to which the city
                    belongs, as well as the date range of the temperature
                    information for that city.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Regions</h3>

            <p>
                The cities are assigned to nine different regions. In the
                "regional" folder, you'll find directory files that tell you
                which states belong to which regions.
            </p>

            <img src="US_Regions_Annotated.jpeg" alt="region map" />

            <h3>Missing Data</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In large datasets, it is common for some data to be missing,
                    and we must decide how to deal with it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fortunately, all dates are present from the starting date to
                    the ending date in this dataset. So, we don't have to worry
                    about missing dates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, some of the dates are missing either the high
                    temperature, or the low temperature, or both. (These data
                    points are recorded as "NA".)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For some cities, only a few dates have missing
                            temperatures, but for other cities, there are large
                            ranges of dates with missing data. (For example, the
                            data for Huntsville AL is missing both the high and
                            the low for all dates from 1959 - 2017!)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our overall strategy is to fill in missing data by taking
                    the average of the nearest preceding point and the nearest
                    following point.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We consider a record to be unusable if it is missing
                            the high or low temperature (or both) for a certain
                            date <strong>AND</strong>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    there is no record in the ten days preceding
                                    that contains the data point;
                                    <strong>OR</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    there is no record in the ten days following
                                    that contains the data point.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                In other words, if a data point is missing,
                                there must be a data point BOTH in the previous
                                ten days prior AND in the following ten days.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We consider a city to be unacceptable if it contains
                            any unusable record(s) for the date range we are
                            interested in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For acceptable cities where either the high or the
                            low is missing, we will fill in the missing
                            temperature by averaging the closest earlier
                            temperature and the closest later temperature.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Examples of Filling in Missing Temperatures</h4>

            <div id="missingDataExample">
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The records for 1928-01-13, 1928-01-14, and
                            1928-01-15 are all usuable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The record for 1928-01-13 is missing the low
                            temperature. To fill it in, we take the closest
                            preceding low (37) and the closest following low
                            (-3) and average them to get 17 ((37-3)/2).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The record for 1928-01-14 is missing both the high
                            and the low. The high will become (38+21)/2 = 29.5,
                            and the low will become (37-3)/2 = 17.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The record for 1928-01-15 is missing the high. The
                            new high will be 29.5, by the same calculation as
                            the high for 1928-01-14.
                        </li>
